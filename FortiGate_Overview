## Key Features

### Firewall Authentication
- Supports both local and remote authentication methods (e.g., LDAP, RADIUS)  
- Enables granular, user-based access control and policy enforcement  

### VPN Capabilities
- Supports IPsec VPN and SSL VPN for secure site-to-site and remote access connectivity  
- Ensures encrypted and authenticated communication across networks  

### Security Scanning
- **Antivirus:** Detects and blocks malware at the network edge  
- **Web Filtering:** Prevents access to malicious or inappropriate content  
- **Application Control:** Identifies and manages traffic based on application signatures  

### Monitoring and Logging
- Real-time network monitoring and traffic visibility  
- Centralized log collection and analysis  
- Integration with FortiAnalyzer and external SIEM platforms for incident correlation and reporting

## Advanced Capabilities

### SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network)
- Efficiently utilizes multiple internet connections for secure, dynamic traffic routing  
- Load balances connections to improve performance and reliability  
- Reduces operational costs while maintaining security and application performance  

### Virtual Domains (VDOMs)
- Allows a single FortiGate appliance to be partitioned into multiple virtual firewalls, each with independent:  
  - Policies  
  - Interfaces  
  - Routing tables  
  - Administrators  
- Ideal for managed service providers (MSPs) or organizations with multiple departments requiring isolation  
- By default, VDOMs are isolated but can be configured to route traffic between each other  
- Enables virtualized network segmentation and secure multi-tenant environments  

### Automation Stitches
- Event-driven automation framework for faster incident response  
- Can be triggered by any local event, cloud-based action, or Security Fabric alert  
- Reduces manual workload and improves consistency in security operations
