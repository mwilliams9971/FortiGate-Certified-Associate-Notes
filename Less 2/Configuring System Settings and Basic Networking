# Lesson 2: Configuring System Settings and Basic Networking

## Administrator Accounts and Access Management

### Best Practices
- Create additional **administrator accounts** instead of relying solely on the default `admin` account.  
  - Reduces dependence on the default admin  
  - Limits access based on job roles  
  - Improves accountability and auditability  

### Administrator Profiles
- New administrator accounts are **not created the same way** as user accounts.  
- **Administrator profiles** define admin permissions.  
  - Each permission can be set to **Read/Write**, **Read**, or **None**.  
- Role-based access helps enforce the principle of least privilege and minimizes security risks.

## Interfaces and Network Configuration

### Physical and Virtual Interfaces
- Interfaces enable traffic to flow between:
  - Internal networks
  - The internet
  - Other network segments  
- FortiGate allows configuration of both **physical** and **virtual** interfaces to manage and segregate traffic.

### Interface Configuration Options
Each interface can be configured with:
- Alias (friendly name)  
- IP address assignment  
- Administrative access control  
- DHCP server settings  
- Interface scaling options (for load balancing or redundancy)

## VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)

### Overview
- VLANs divide a single physical LAN into multiple **virtual networks**.  
- Each VLAN forms its own **broadcast domain**.  
- Traffic between VLANs is **tagged** using a VLAN ID.  
- The most common tagging protocol is **IEEE 802.1Q**.

### Benefits of VLANs
- Isolate devices for better security  
- Reduce unnecessary broadcast traffic  
- Segregate network traffic by type (e.g., user, voice, or management networks)

## VLAN Deployment Modes

### 1. NAT Mode (Layer 3)
- VLANs function as **Layer 3 subinterfaces** on physical ports.  
- Each subinterface has a unique VLAN ID.  
- FortiGate adds or removes VLAN tags depending on packet direction.  
- **Security policies** can be applied individually to each VLAN subinterface.  
- Enables FortiGate to control traffic between internal VLANs and external networks.

### 2. Transparent Mode (Layer 2)
- Operates as a **Layer 2 bridge**.  
- VLAN-tagged traffic passes through the device while still applying security features such as:
  - Antivirus scanning  
  - Web filtering  
  - Intrusion prevention  
- Some services (e.g., SSL VPNs, DHCP servers, full NAT) are **not supported** in this mode.  
- Ideal when **network changes must be minimal**.  
- Requires matching VLAN subinterfaces on both internal and external interfaces.

### 3. Virtual VLAN Switch (Supported Models)
- Allows hardware switch ports to operate as a **managed Layer 2 switch**.  
- Ports can be:
  - Assigned to specific VLANs, or  
  - Configured as **trunk ports** for VLAN tagging.  
- Useful in **High Availability (HA)** setups or when extending VLANs between devices.

## DHCP and IP Configuration

- FortiGate can run **one or more DHCP servers** on any interface.  
- Simplifies IP management for connected hosts.  
- Supports both static and dynamic IP address allocation.

## Static Routing

### Overview
- **Static routing** is the most basic form of network routing configuration.  
- FortiGate includes a **default route** to its gateway, enabling internet access for internal devices.  
- Each static route includes:
  - **Destination** – Determines which traffic matches the route  
  - **Gateway Address** – The next-hop IP FortiGate forwards traffic to  
  - **Interface** – The physical or virtual interface used to send the traffic  

### Default Route
- The **default route** tells FortiGate where to send traffic when there is **no exact match** in the routing table.  
- Static routes remain in the configuration until deleted manually.

### Management and Troubleshooting
- All configured routes are visible under **Network → Static Routes** in the FortiGate GUI.  
- Creating a static route does not guarantee its usage; possible reasons include:
  - Misconfigured route parameters  
  - Associated port is down or disabled  
  - A more specific or preferred route exists  

**Tip:** Checking the **routing table** should be one of the first troubleshooting steps when diagnosing network connectivity issues.

## Summary
This lesson covers essential FortiGate networking concepts, including administrator account management, VLAN segmentation, interface configuration, DHCP setup, and static routing.  
Understanding these fundamentals ensures proper network segmentation, secure administrative access, and reliable data flow between internal and external networks.
