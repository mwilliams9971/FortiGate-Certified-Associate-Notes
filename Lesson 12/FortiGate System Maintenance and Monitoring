## Learning Objectives
- Perform common FortiGate maintenance tasks  
- Backup and restore a FortiGate configuration  
- Upgrade FortiGate firmware  
- Monitor FortiGate resource utilization  
- Examine FortiGate licenses  
- Monitor FortiGate logs

## 1. Performing Common FortiGate Maintenance Tasks
Regular maintenance ensures that the FortiGate device continues operating securely and efficiently.

### Importance of Maintenance
- Prevents **security breaches** by keeping firmware and signatures current  
- Optimizes **system performance and stability**  
- Helps meet **compliance requirements**  
- Ensures **business continuity** during hardware failures or migrations  

### Common Maintenance Tasks
- Back up and restore configurations  
- Perform firmware upgrades  
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk)  
- Review license status and renewals  
- Monitor and analyze logs

## 2. Backup and Restore Configuration
Regular configuration backups protect against accidental misconfiguration, hardware failure, or data loss.

### Key Points
- Create backups **before major configuration changes or firmware upgrades.**  
- Backups can be saved **locally**, to a **USB drive**, or to an **external management platform** (e.g., FortiManager).  
- Restores are performed through the **GUI** under *System > Settings > Restore Configuration*.  
- Devices with at least **512 MB of flash memory** can store local backups on the device itself.  
- Store multiple backup versions securely in case of rollback needs.

## 3. Upgrading FortiGate Firmware
Fortinet regularly releases firmware updates to add features, fix bugs, and improve performance.

### Steps and Recommendations
1. **Check for new releases:**  
   - FortiGate displays a notification when new firmware is available if a valid license is active.  
2. **Review release notes:**  
   - Ensure compatibility with your FortiGate model and current version.  
3. **Back up your configuration** before upgrading.  
4. **Follow the Fortinet Upgrade Path Tool** for multi-version jumps.  
   - Available on the Fortinet Customer Service & Support Portal.  
   - Following the recommended path ensures stability and compatibility.  
5. **Upgrade via GUI or CLI:**  
   - *GUI:* `System > Firmware`  
   - *CLI:*  
     ```bash
     execute restore image tftp <filename> <server_ip>
     execute reboot
     ```  
6. **Firmware maturity tags (FortiOS 7.2+):**  
   - **F** = Feature release (new functionality)  
   - **M** = Mature release (stability and long-term support)  

**Tip:** When in doubt, select an **M-release** for production environments.

## 4. Monitoring FortiGate Resource Utilization
Continuous monitoring helps detect performance bottlenecks early.

### Key Metrics
- **CPU Usage:** High sustained usage may indicate heavy inspection load.  
- **Memory Usage:** Excessive memory consumption can impact session handling.  
- **Disk Space:** Needed for logs and quarantine storage.  
- **Session Count / Log Rate:** Indicates throughput and logging volume.  

### Monitoring Tools
- **Dashboard Widgets** â€“ configurable to show CPU, memory, and session information.  
- **CLI Commands:**
  ```bash
  get system performance status
  diagnose sys top
  get system stat
