- Monitor authentication activities

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Importance of Firewall Authentication
- **Firewall authentication** ensures users verify their identity before accessing network resources.  
- Without authentication, FortiGate only knows a user's **source IP address**, which does not uniquely identify them.  
- Authentication enables **user-based security policies** rather than IP-based ones ‚Äî allowing more precise access control, logging, and reporting.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How FortiGate Firewall Authentication Works
- You configure authentication by adding a **source user or user group** to a **firewall policy**.  
- FortiGate uses **user identity** (in addition to source, destination, and service) to determine whether traffic is allowed or denied.  
- Each user who requires access must have an account (local or remote).  
- When traffic matches a policy that requires authentication:
  - FortiGate presents a **login prompt (Captive Portal)**.
  - The user authenticates.
  - FortiGate associates the username with the session for the duration of authentication timeout.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Authentication
FortiGate supports two main types of authentication, depending on where user credentials are stored:

### üî∏ Local Password Authentication
- Simplest method; credentials are stored directly on the FortiGate.  
- Ideal for **standalone** FortiGate setups.  
- Users authenticate with a **username and password** defined locally.  
- Users can be grouped for simplified policy management.  
- **Best practice:** Apply policies to **user groups**, not individual accounts.  
- Useful for **guest access** (administrators can create temporary guest accounts).  

### üî∏ Remote Password Authentication
- FortiGate sends credentials to a **remote authentication server**, such as **FortiAuthenticator**, **RADIUS**, or **LDAP/Active Directory**.  
- FortiGate does **not** store credentials locally.  
- Preferred when multiple FortiGate devices or services share the same user directory.  
- Common in enterprise networks where central identity management is required.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Authentication

### üß© Local Authentication Configuration Steps
1. **Create local user accounts** on the FortiGate.  
2. **Create a user group** and add the local user(s).  
3. **Add the user group** to the **source** field of the desired firewall policy.  
4. **Apply the policy** to the appropriate internal interface/subnet.  
5. **Verify configuration** and **monitor active users** using:
   - **Dashboard ‚Ä∫ Users & Devices**
   - **Log & Report ‚Ä∫ Event Logs ‚Ä∫ User Events**

### üåê Remote Authentication Configuration Steps
1. **Add or configure** the remote authentication server (e.g., LDAP, RADIUS, FortiAuthenticator).  
2. **Create a user group** that references remote users.  
3. **Add the group** to the firewall policy‚Äôs source.  
4. **Apply and test** authentication from a client device.  
5. **Monitor sessions and logs** to confirm successful authentication.

## üìä Key Monitoring Tools
- **FortiView ‚Ä∫ Users** ‚Äî Displays authenticated user sessions.  
- **System ‚Ä∫ Dashboard ‚Ä∫ Users & Devices Widget** ‚Äî Shows real-time login status.  
- **Log & Report ‚Ä∫ Event Logs ‚Ä∫ User Events** ‚Äî Records authentication successes/failures.  
- **CLI Command Example:**  
  ```bash
  diagnose debug authd fsso list
